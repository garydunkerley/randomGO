# randomGO

The goal of this project is to create a simple web application with a UI that allows one to play a variation of Go on randomly generated boards.

We would also like to test existing Go algorithms in this setting to see how they might perform in these variations, what the asymptotic behavior of the algorithms is under given board parameters, and which parameters may create boards that are fun for humans to play on.

# TODO

 - Modify random graph generation function so that all graphs are guaranteed to be planar. 
 - Create an algorithm for visualizing our random planar graph without singularities.
 - Develop protocol to allow playing over a network.
